I had a dream that wifey was cuddling with some random dude. I was working or something and she was still sleeping in this dudes arms. They were “friends” and they tried to play it off.

Thing is, my wife never sleeps in my arms and is not the hugging type. I am. So aside from the fact that this was some other dude holding my wife, I was even more pissed off about the fact she slept cuddled up with him.

Just as I noticed this was happening and asked “WTH is this?” I woke up. Lucky for them cause it was most certainly about to hit the fan. lol.
